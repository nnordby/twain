Tokens are used within HTML to create merged output from data derived from a user's accounts, a partner selected for a particular piece, or from the library's document properties.  They are constructed in a variety of ways but always contain the parent node first (the underlined un-indented items below) followed by a period and then the child property (indented items); e.g. ```user.cellPhone```
Most common will be the use of the standard replace token ```vf-var="user.cellPhone"``` but it is also acceptable to use the legacy {% raw %} ```{{user.cellPhone}}``` {% endraw %} (formerly: ```$$user.cellPhone$$```)  when the circumstance requires it, such as constructing a URL.  You can also use another special token to hide an entire element if variable data is missing:  ```vf-show="user.cellPhone"```.  In other words, "Show the element if the selected data is present. If it's not, don't."
Another important token is ```vf-insert```.  This token will insert another file into the area defined and would be applied as Example 4 demonstrates below.

##### Example 1
```html
<span vf-var="user.cellPhone" vf-show="user.cellPhone">Cell: 208-854-7900</span>
```
##### Example 2
```html
<div vf-show="user.cellPhone">
<span>Cell: </span><span vf-var="user.cellPhone">208-854-7900</span>
 </div>
```
##### Example 3
```html
<span vf-var="user.address1>5465 E. Terra Linda Way</span> <span vf-show="user.address2"> ,</span> <span vf-var="user.address2" vf-show="user.address2">Suite 293</span>
```
##### Example 4
```html
<div id="contactAreaContainer" vf-insert="template.contactArea">Contact Information</div>
```
In the Example 1 above, the entire span will be removed if the cell phone is missing.  If it is present, the contents of the span (Cell: 208-854-7900) will be replaced with just the cell phone.  To pre-pend variable data with a label, follow Example 2.
In the Example 2 above, we can pre-pend variable data with a label, but remove the entire container if the cell phone value is missing, thereby avoiding a hanging label with nothing attached to it.
In the Example 3 above, we can bring Address 1 and Address 2 together with a comma separating the two fields, but remove both the comma and the Address 2 line if there is no Address 2 present.
