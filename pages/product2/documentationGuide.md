### Getting Started

The Documentation Repository should be pulled from the NSN Documentation Git Repository and stored locally on your computer.  Any IDE you use should have the ability to commit to Git any new documents or changes made to existing documents.  The Atom IDE is made by Git and has excellent publishing capabilities and some great snippets have been created for Atom as well to help automate some of the documentation tasks.  For these reasons, it is recommended that you use Atom as your documentation vehicle.
